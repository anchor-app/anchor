 Authenticate against the FullContact v3.0 OAuth API (see https://api.fullcontact.com/v3/docs/authentication/), objtaining an access token and refresh token. This is a two step process.

 First, this will redirect the user to Safari to login with their FullContact credentials and when the
 login is complete, it expects this app to respond to the callback URL provided in the initializer.
 When responding to that URL, call `handleAuthenticationCallback:` on the same instance you called `authenticateWithCompletion:`.
 
 Second, it will take the code it receives from the redirect URL to retrieve a token pair from FullContact. Then it will call the provided completion block.

 @param scope Comma delimited string specifying access scopes, see https://api.fullcontact.com/v3/docs/scopes/
 @param completion Block to run when authentication operation completes.
